Uncertain Periodic Frequent Pattern mining
===========================================

Uncertain periodic frequent pattern mining is a data mining task that involves the discovery of periodic patterns from datasets containing uncertain or probabilistic data.
Unlike traditional periodic frequent pattern mining, which deals with deterministic data,
uncertain periodic frequent pattern mining addresses the challenges posed by uncertainty in the data,
where each item or attribute may have associated probabilities or uncertainties.

Applications: Healthcare, Environmental Monitoring, Financial Forecasting.
