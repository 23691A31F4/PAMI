Local Periodic Pattern Mining
================================

Local Periodic Patterns (LPPs) which are patterns that have a periodic behavior in some non-predefined time-intervals.
A pattern is said to be a local periodic pattern if it appears regularly and continuously in some time interval (s).
A pattern is considered a local periodic pattern if it demonstrates periodic behavior within one or more distinct time intervals,
indicating temporal regularity that may vary across different segments of the dataset.
Unlike traditional periodic patterns, which assume consistent periodic behavior over time,
LPPs are characterized by their regular and continuous appearance within certain time intervals.

Applications: Anomaly Detection, Time Series Forecasting, Resource Management.
