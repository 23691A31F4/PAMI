Correlated Pattern Mining
==========================

Correlated patterns are specific types of regularities or associations that exist within a dataset,
where the occurrence of certain items or attributes is statistically correlated with the occurrence of other items or attributes.
These patterns represent meaningful relationships or dependencies between different sets of items or attributes,
and their discovery can provide valuable insights into the underlying structure and behavior of the data.

Applications: Fraud Detection, Supply Chain Management, Healthcare Data Analysis, Retail Market Analysis.
