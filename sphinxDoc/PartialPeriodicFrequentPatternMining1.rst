Partial Periodic Frequent Pattern Mining
=========================================

Partial Periodic-Frequent Patterns in a temporal database are recurring patterns that exhibit partial cyclic repetitions over time.
Unlike full periodic-frequent patterns, which require complete cyclic repetitions, partial periodic-frequent patterns capture temporal regularities that may not follow a strict periodicity.
These patterns represent recurring behaviors or events within specific time intervals, where the frequency of occurrence varies but still demonstrates a degree of periodicity.
The interestingness of a partial periodic-frequent pattern is determined by its periodic ratio, which measures the proportion of cyclic repetitions it exhibits in the database.

Applications: Predictive Maintenance, Traffic Management, Environmental Monitoring.
