Uncertain Geo-Referenced Frequent Pattern mining
==================================================

Uncertain geo-referenced frequent pattern mining is a data mining task that involves the discovery of
frequent patterns from datasets containing uncertain or probabilistic data with geographic references.
In uncertain geo-referenced data, each item or attribute is associated with a geographical location,
and uncertainty arises from the probabilistic nature of the data,
where the occurrence of events or patterns may vary with associated probabilities or uncertainties.

Applications: Location-based Services, Urban Planning and Development, Emergency Response and Disaster Management.
