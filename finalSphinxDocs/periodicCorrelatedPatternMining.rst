Periodic correlated pattern mining is a data mining task aimed at discovering patterns within a temporal database that exhibit both periodic behavior and correlation between their occurrences.
Unlike traditional periodic pattern mining, which focuses solely on periodicity, periodic correlated pattern mining considers the relationship between pattern occurrences over time.
These patterns are characterized by their recurring nature and the presence of correlations between occurrences at specific time intervals.

Applications: Retail Sales Analysis, Web Usage Mining, Healthcare Monitoring.
