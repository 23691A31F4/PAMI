Uncertain Frequent Pattern mining
===================================

Uncertain frequent pattern mining is a data mining task that involves the discovery of frequent patterns from datasets containing uncertain or probabilistic data.
Unlike traditional frequent pattern mining, where the data is precise and deterministic,
uncertain frequent pattern mining deals with data in which the values or attributes have associated probabilities or uncertainties.

Applications: Healthcare, Finance, Environmental Science.
