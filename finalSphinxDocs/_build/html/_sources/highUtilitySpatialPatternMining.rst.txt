High utility spatial pattern mining involves the identification of patterns in spatial datasets where each pattern has high utility,
reflecting its significance or importance in the context of the application domain.
These patterns consist of spatially distributed items or events that occur frequently and contribute significantly to a predefined utility measure.

Applications: Resource Management, Precision Agriculture, Emergency Response and Disaster Management.
