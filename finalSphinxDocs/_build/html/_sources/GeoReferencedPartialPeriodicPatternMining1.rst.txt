Geo-referenced Partial Periodic Pattern Mining
==================================================

Geo-referenced partial periodic frequent pattern mining is a data mining technique that aims to discover recurring spatial-temporal patterns in datasets where events occur periodically
but may not always cover the entire time period of interest.
In other words, it focuses on identifying patterns that exhibit periodicity in both space and time, but allow for variations or partial occurrences within each period.

Applications: Agricultural Monitoring and Crop Management, Public Health Surveillance, Environmental Monitoring and Disaster Management.
