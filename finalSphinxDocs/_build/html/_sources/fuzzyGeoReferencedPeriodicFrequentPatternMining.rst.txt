Fuzzy geo-referenced periodic frequent pattern mining involves the discovery of recurring patterns in spatial-temporal data.
where the occurrences exhibit fuzzy relationships or uncertainties and are associated with geographical locations.
These patterns capture the repetitive nature of events or phenomena over time and space, while considering imprecise or
fuzzy attributes and relationships between spatial-temporal entities.

Applications: Traffic Flow Analysis, Environmental Monitoring, Epidemiological Studies.
