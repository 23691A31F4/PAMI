Fuzzy Correlated Pattern Mining
==================================================

Fuzzy correlated pattern mining involves the exploration of associations between fuzzy itemsets that exhibit linear relationships,as assessed through fuzzy correlation analysis.
Instead of solely relying on co-occurrence frequencies,
this approach considers the strength and type of correlation between fuzzy itemsets to uncover meaningful patterns.

Applications: Market Basket Analysis, Healthcare Analytics, Financial Forecasting.
