## Need for main method

The users can execute any pattern mining algorithm in PAMI directly from the terminal. We need a "main" method to do so in Python.

### Declaring a class and its main method
```Python
#Step 1: declare a class
class patternMiningAlgorithm:
# write your code here

#Step 2: create a main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    #read the input parameters
    _ap = str()
    #write your code here
```
