## Casing style followed in PAMI

Python coders mostly use snake casing for coding purposes. However, we request the 
coders to develop the algorithms in '_camel casing_,' which is a popular convention.

### What is camel casing?

CamelCase is a way to separate the words in a phrase by making the first letter of each word capitalized and not using spaces.

### An example

1. The variable "minimum support" is written as _minSup_.
2. A method having the name "get patterns" is written as _getPatterns()_.
