# Spatiotemporal database

 A temporal database as described above is said to be a spatiotemporal database if its items
represent spatial objects. In other words, a spatiotemporal database is a combination of spatial database and temporal database.
   The format of the spatial database is as follows:
   
         item : spatialInformation (pixel, point, line, polygon)

   A sample spatial database for the set of items, I={a,b,c,d,e,f}, is shown in below table.
  
 Item |  Spatial information 
  --- | -----
  a   | Point(0 0)
  b   | Point(0 1)
  c   | Point(1 0)
  d   | Point(0 2)
  e   | Point(4 0)
  f   | Point(5 1)
