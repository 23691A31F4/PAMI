Fuzzy Frequent Pattern Mining
===================================

Fuzzy frequent patterns (FFPs) are patterns that capture the inherent uncertainty or fuzziness in data by allowing for partial matching of items or events.
Unlike traditional frequent patterns, which require exact matches between items or events,
fuzzy frequent patterns accommodate variations in the degree of membership or similarity between items, making them suitable for data with uncertain or imprecise information

Applications: Medical Data Mining, Financial Analysis, Manufacturing and Quality Control.
