Frequent pattern With Multiple Minimum Support
===============================================

Frequent patterns with multiple minimum support refer to patterns in a dataset that occur frequently and meet multiple minimum support thresholds.
Unlike traditional frequent pattern mining, which uses a single uniform minimum support threshold for all items, this approach considers varying levels of support for different items in the dataset.
By using multiple minimum support thresholds, it allows for a more nuanced analysis, where the significance of each item is evaluated individually based on its characteristics and importance in the context of the dataset.

Applications: Network Traffic Analysis, Manufacturing Process Optimization, Healthcare Data Analysis, Retail Market Analysis.
