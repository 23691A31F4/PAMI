Multiple Partial Periodic Pattern Mining
=========================================

Multiple partial periodic pattern mining is a data mining technique focused on identifying recurring patterns or
sequences of events that occur periodically but may not cover the entire duration of the periodic cycle.
It involves analyzing datasets where multiple partial periodic patterns exist, with each pattern representing a subset of events recurring at regular intervals.
