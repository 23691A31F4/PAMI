Partial Periodic Pattern Mining
==================================

Partial periodic pattern mining involves the identification of recurring patterns or sequences within a dataset that exhibit partial periodic behavior.
Unlike traditional periodic pattern mining, where patterns repeat exactly at regular intervals, partial periodic patterns may exhibit variations or irregularities
in their periodicity. These patterns may occur intermittently or periodically with some degree of variability, making them challenging to detect using conventional
mining techniques.
Applications: Healthcare Monitoring, Financial Time Series Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis.
