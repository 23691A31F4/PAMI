High-Utility Pattern mining
============================

The aim of high-utility pattern mining (HUPM) is to discover meaningful patterns in medical databases that contribute to maximizing the utility from the perspective of diagnosis.
However, HUPM pays less attention to the interpretability and explainability of these patterns in medical decision-making scenarios.

Applications: Clinical Decision Support, Drug Prescription and Therapy Planning, Disease Diagnosis and Prediction.
