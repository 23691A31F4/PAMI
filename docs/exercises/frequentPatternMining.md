# Mining Frequent Patterns in Very Large Databases

##[Exercise 1: Mining frequent patterns in very large databases using a single algorithm](exercise1.html)
In this exercise, we will first create a very large synthetic database. Next, we will understand the characteristics of the 
generated database. Next, using Frequent Pattern-growth algorithm, we will find frequent patterns by varying minimum 
Support (minSup) threshold value. Finally, we will visualize the results. 
          

##[Exercise 2: Evaluation of several frequent pattern mining algorithms](exercise2.html)
In this exercise, we will first create several synthetic databases. Next, we will understand the characteristics of the 
generated databases. Next, we will evaluate the performance of various frequent pattern mining algorithms at different minimum support values. 
Finally, the evaluation results of various frequent pattern mining algorithms will be evaluated.
