# Mining Frequent Patterns in Very Large Databases

##[Exercise 1: Mining frequent patterns in very large databases using a sequential algorithm](exercise1.html)
In this exercise, we will first create a very large synthetic database. Next, we will understand the characteristics of the 
generated database. Next, using Frequent Pattern-growth algorithm, we will find frequent patterns by varying minimum 
Support (minSup) threshold value. Finally, we will visualize the results. 
          

##[Exercise 2: Evaluation of multiple frequent pattern mining algorithms](exercise2.html)
In this exercise, we will first create several synthetic databases. Next, we will understand the characteristics of the 
generated databases. Next, we will evaluate the performance of various frequent pattern mining algorithms at different minimum support values. 
Finally, the evaluation results of various frequent pattern mining algorithms will be presented.


##[Exercise 3: Mining frequent patterns in big data using parallel algorithm](exercise3.html)
In this exercise, we will first create a very large synthetic databases. Next, we will understand the characteristics of the 
generated database. Next, we will find frequent patterns using a parallel algorithm, called Parallel Frequent Pattern-Growth. 
Finally, the evaluation results of various frequent pattern mining algorithms will be presented.


**Note:** This exercise will work only on the host machines that support Map-reduce framework. 

##[Exercise 4: Mining frequent patterns in big data using CUDA ECLAT algorithm](exercise4.html)
In this exercise, we will first create a very large synthetic databases. Next, we will understand the characteristics of the 
generated database. Next, we will find frequent patterns using a cuda_ECLAT algorithm. 
Finally, we visualize the results.

**Note:** This exercise will work only on the host machines that support CUDA GPUs.
